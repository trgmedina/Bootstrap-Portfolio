           				<p>I am currently a Legal Assistant working in corporate and transactional law. I was born in the East Coast but raised and reside in Chicago. I live a charmed life with my dog, Mochi, in the Northwest Side.</p>

						<p>I graduated from DePaul University with a degree in Computer Animation concentrating on Game Art and Design. Currently, I attend a Coding Boot Camp at Northwestern's School of Professional Studies. My goal is to make a career switch into web or mobile app development. I want to be able to utilize my animation background alongside the skills I am learning in the Coding Boot Camp.</p>

						<p>On my free time you can find me trying out new restaurants, hiking up mountains, training at my local boxing gym, practicing yoga in random locations, reading on the CTA, rearranging my fantasy sports teams, binge-watching Netflix, or playing Legend of Zelda games on my 3DS.</p>
